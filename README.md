# GSP-Py
A **Python implementation** of the Generalized Sequence Pattern (GSP) algorithm for mining sequential patterns in datasets. GSP is a powerful algorithm for discovering sequences of events or items that are frequently observed, making it suitable for a wide range of domains such as market basket analysis, web usage mining, and bioinformatics.

## üîç What is GSP?

The **Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP)** algorithm is a sequential pattern mining technique based on **Apriori principles**. Using support thresholds, GSP identifies frequent sequences of items in transaction datasets.

### Key Features:
- **Support-based pruning**: Only retains sequences that meet the minimum support threshold.
- **Candidate generation**: Iteratively generates candidate sequences of increasing length.
- **General-purpose**: Useful in retail, web analytics, social networks, temporal sequence mining, and more.

For example:
- In a shopping dataset, GSP can identify patterns like "Customers who buy bread and milk often purchase diapers next."
- In a website clickstream, GSP might find patterns like "Users visit A, then go to B, and later proceed to C."

## ‚úÖ Requirements

You will need Python installed on your system. On most Linux systems, you can install Python with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

For package dependencies of GSP-Py, they will automatically be installed when using `pip`.

---

## üöÄ Installation

GSP-Py can be easily installed either by cloning the repository or using pip.

### Option 1: Clone the Repository
To manually clone the repository and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gsp-py.git
cd gsp-py
python setup.py install
```

### Option 2: Install via `pip`
Alternatively, install GSP-Py from PyPI with:
```bash
pip install gsppy
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Installation

For contributors and developers, GSP-Py provides additional dependencies for development purposes (e.g., testing and linting).

To install the package along with development dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

The `dev` category includes tools such as `pytest`, `pylint`, and others to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## üí° Usage

The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate with your own projects. Below is an example of how you can configure and run GSP-Py.

### Example Input Data
The input to the algorithm is a sequence of transactions, where each transaction contains a sequence of items:
```python
transactions = [
    ['Bread', 'Milk'],
    ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
    ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
]
```

### Importing and Initializing the GSP Algorithm
Import the `GSP` class from the `gsppy` package and call the `search` method to find frequent patterns with a support threshold (e.g., `0.3`):
```python
from gsppy.gsp import GSP

# Define the input data
transactions = [
    ['Bread', 'Milk'],
    ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
    ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
]

# Minimum support set to 30%
min_support = 0.3

# Find frequent patterns
result = GSP(transactions).search(min_support)

# Output the results
print(result)
```

### Output
The algorithm will return a list of patterns with their corresponding support.

### Understanding Support
The **support** of a sequence is the fraction of total data-sequences that "contain" the sequence. For instance, if the pattern `[Bread, Milk]` appears in 3 out of 5 transactions, its support is `3 / 5 = 0.6`.

For more complex examples, find example scripts in the [`gsppy/tests`](gsppy/tests) folder.

## üåü Planned Features

We are actively working to improve GSP-Py. Here are some exciting features planned for future releases:

1. **Custom Filters for Candidate Pruning**:
   - Enable users to define their own pruning logic during the mining process.

2. **Support for Preprocessing and Postprocessing**:
   - Add hooks to allow users to transform datasets before mining and customize the output results.

3. **Support for Time-Constrained Pattern Mining**:
   - Extend GSP-Py to handle temporal datasets by allowing users to define time constraints (e.g., maximum time gaps between events, time windows) during the sequence mining process.
   - Enable candidate pruning and support calculations based on these temporal constraints.
