# GSP-Py

**GSP-Py**: A Python-powered library to mine sequential patterns in large datasets, based on the robust **Generalized
Sequence Pattern (GSP)** algorithm. Ideal for market basket analysis, temporal mining, and user journey discovery.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GSP-Py is compatible with Python 3.8 and later versions!

## üîç What is GSP?

The **Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP)** algorithm is a sequential pattern mining technique based on **Apriori
principles**. Using support thresholds, GSP identifies frequent sequences of items in transaction datasets.

### Key Features:

- **Support-based pruning**: Only retains sequences that meet the minimum support threshold.
- **Candidate generation**: Iteratively generates candidate sequences of increasing length.
- **General-purpose**: Useful in retail, web analytics, social networks, temporal sequence mining, and more.

For example:

- In a shopping dataset, GSP can identify patterns like "Customers who buy bread and milk often purchase diapers next."
- In a website clickstream, GSP might find patterns like "Users visit A, then go to B, and later proceed to C."

---

## üîß Requirements

You will need Python installed on your system. On most Linux systems, you can install Python with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

For package dependencies of GSP-Py, they will automatically be installed when using `pip`.

---

## üöÄ Installation

GSP-Py can be easily installed from either the **repository** or PyPI.

### Option 1: Clone the Repository

To manually clone the repository and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gsp-py.git
cd gsp-py
python setup.py install
```

### Option 2: Install via `pip`

Alternatively, install GSP-Py from PyPI with:

```bash
pip install gsppy
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Installation

For contributors and developers, GSP-Py provides additional dependencies for development purposes (e.g., testing and
linting).

To install the package along with development dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

The `dev` category includes tools such as `pytest`, `pylint`, and others to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## üí° Usage

The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate with your own projects. Below is an example of how you can
configure and run GSP-Py.

### Example Input Data

The input to the algorithm is a sequence of transactions, where each transaction contains a sequence of items:

```python
transactions = [
    ['Bread', 'Milk'],
    ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
    ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
]
```

### Importing and Initializing the GSP Algorithm

Import the `GSP` class from the `gsppy` package and call the `search` method to find frequent patterns with a support
threshold (e.g., `0.3`):

```python
from gsppy.gsp import GSP

# Example transactions: customer purchases
transactions = [
    ['Bread', 'Milk'],  # Transaction 1
    ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],  # Transaction 2
    ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],  # Transaction 3
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],  # Transaction 4
    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']  # Transaction 5
]

# Set minimum support threshold (30%)
min_support = 0.3

# Find frequent patterns
result = GSP(transactions).search(min_support)

# Output the results
print(result)
```

### Output

The algorithm will return a list of patterns with their corresponding support.

Sample Output:

```python
[
    {('Bread',): 4, ('Milk',): 4, ('Diaper',): 4, ('Beer',): 3, ('Coke',): 2},
    {('Bread', 'Milk'): 3, ('Milk', 'Diaper'): 3, ('Diaper', 'Beer'): 3},
    {('Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper'): 2, ('Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'): 2}
]
```

- The **first dictionary** contains single-item sequences with their frequencies (e.g., `('Bread',): 4` means "Bread"
  appears in 4 transactions).
- The **second dictionary** contains 2-item sequential patterns (e.g., `('Bread', 'Milk'): 3` means the sequence "
  Bread ‚Üí Milk" appears in 3 transactions).
- The **third dictionary** contains 3-item sequential patterns (e.g., `('Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper'): 2` means the
  sequence "Bread ‚Üí Milk ‚Üí Diaper" appears in 2 transactions).

> [!NOTE]
> The **support** of a sequence is calculated as the fraction of transactions containing the sequence, e.g.,
`[Bread, Milk]` appears in 3 out of 5 transactions ‚Üí Support = `3 / 5 = 0.6` (60%).
> This insight helps identify frequently occurring sequential patterns in datasets, such as shopping trends or user
> behavior.


> [!TIP]
> For more complex examples, find example scripts in the [`gsppy/tests`](gsppy/tests) folder.

## üåü Planned Features

We are actively working to improve GSP-Py. Here are some exciting features planned for future releases:

1. **Custom Filters for Candidate Pruning**:
    - Enable users to define their own pruning logic during the mining process.

2. **Support for Preprocessing and Postprocessing**:
    - Add hooks to allow users to transform datasets before mining and customize the output results.

3. **Support for Time-Constrained Pattern Mining**:
    - Extend GSP-Py to handle temporal datasets by allowing users to define time constraints (e.g., maximum time gaps
      between events, time windows) during the sequence mining process.
    - Enable candidate pruning and support calculations based on these temporal constraints.
