```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gsp-py.git
cd gsp-py
```

### **3. Create a New Branch**
Create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```
Use a descriptive branch name, such as `fix/issue-123` or `feature/custom-filter-support`.

### **4. Make Changes**
- Edit and test your code locally.
- Ensure any new features include unit tests.

### **5. Run Tests**
Before submitting your changes, ensure the code passes all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

If you're adding a new feature, include tests for it in the `tests/` directory.

### **6. Push Changes**
Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a brief but descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### **7. Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
- Navigate to the main repository's GitHub page and select **Pull Requests**.
- Click **New Pull Request** and provide details about your changes, including:
  - A clear summary of your contribution.

## Coding Standards and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and code quality, please follow these coding guidelines:

1. **Formatting**:
   - Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code style conventions.
   - Use tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to ensure your code is formatted correctly:
     ```bash
     pylint path/to/file.py
     ```

2. **Commit Messages**:
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Begin your commit message with an action verb, such as "Add," "Fix," "Improve," "Update," etc.
   - For example: `Fix candidate pruning for short sequences`.

3. **Tests**:
   - Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
   - Use `pytest` as the testing framework.
   - Place tests in the `tests/` directory using descriptive test names.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, comments in code) related to your changes.
   - If a new feature is added, provide usage examples and explanation.

## Getting Started with the Codebase

To get familiar with the existing code, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**:
   This project uses [Rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye) for managing dependencies and the virtual environment. Follow these instructions to set it up:

   - Install Rye (if not already installed):
     ```bash
     curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash
     ```

     Make sure Rye's binary directory is added to your `PATH`:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$HOME/.rye/bin:$PATH"
     ```

   - Install project dependencies using Rye:
     ```bash
     rye sync
     ```

     This command reads the dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file and installs them into a local environment managed by Rye.

2. **Run Tests**:
   Use Rye to run tests and verify the baseline state:
   ```bash
   rye run test
   ```

   The `test` script is defined in the `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.rye.scripts]` and uses `pytest`.

3. **Explore the Code**:
   The main entry point for the GSP algorithm is in the `gsppy` module. The libraries for support counting, candidate generation, and additional utility functions are also within this module.

---

### Notes:
- No need to create a `venv` or install dependencies manually with `pip`; Rye handles everything based on the `pyproject.toml` file.
- If youâ€™re unfamiliar with Rye, refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye).

## Reporting Issues

To report a bug or suggest an enhancement, open an issue on GitHub:

1. **Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gsp-py/issues) page**.
2. Select **New Issue** and choose the appropriate issue template:
   - Bug report
   - Feature request
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
   - Clear description of the feature or enhancement (for feature requests).
