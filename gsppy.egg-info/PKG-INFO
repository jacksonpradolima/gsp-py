        ## Requirements
        
        Install Python:
        
        ```console
        sudo apt install python3
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        To download GSP-Py just clone the Git repository hosted in GitHub:
        
        ```console
        git clone https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gsp-py.git
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can install it with `pip`:
        
        ```console
        pip install gsppy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Examples of configuring and running are located in the *test* folders [gsppy folder](gsppy).
        
        To use it in a project, import it and use the GSP class.
        
        ```console
        from gsppy.gsp import GSP
        ```
        
        It is assumed that your transactions are a sequence of sequences representing items in baskets. 
        
        ```console
         transactions = [
                    ['Bread', 'Milk'],
                    ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
                    ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
                    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
                    ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
                ]
        ```
        
        Init the class to prepare the transactions and to find patterns in baskets that occur over the support threshold (count):
        
        ```console
        result = GSP(transactions).search(0.3)
        ```
        
        The support count (or simply support) for a sequence is defined as the fraction of total data-sequences that "contain" this sequence.
        (Although the word "contains" is not strictly accurate once we incorporate taxonomies, it captures the spirt of when a data-sequence contributes to the support of a sequential pattern.)
